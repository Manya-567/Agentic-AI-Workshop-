Like, have students use AI to explore ideas or get quick feedback, but then they gotta explain stuff in their own words or apply what they‚Äôve learned in ways AI can‚Äôt just spit out for them. You know, push them to think critically after getting that AI boost. [...] I agree that integrating AI tools is the best approach. LLMs can be setup as a personal tutor for a given curriculum. So each student can have llm answer questions they have, and step then through things, focusing on the areas they are struggling with, rather than 1 teacher for 30 kids. This 1 to 1 support is likely to be a big improvement in education.
