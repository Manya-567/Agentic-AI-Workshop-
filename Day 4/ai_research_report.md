# Abstract [...] **Retail:** AI could automate 50% of work hours in retail, impacting jobs related to inventory management, customer service, and sales operations. This shift may enhance service efficiency and personalize customer experiences, though it could also lead to significant job restructuring[6][9].

**Transportation and Warehousing:** Very high around 80% due to self-driving vehicles and automated logistics[8].
- **AI is likely to impact careers. How can organizations help ... - Deloitte**
  - Deloitte surveyed 1,874 workers from the United States, Canada, India, and Australia from July 17 to 31, 2024, to study the impact of AI on their career pathways, growth, learning opportunities, and work experiences. The respondents included 65% early career workers (with up to and including five years of total work experience) and 35% tenured workers (with six or more years of total work experience). The respondents represented diverse industries, functions, organization sizes, and career

### 2. How will AI-driven automation reshape skill requirements across different job sectors?
- **How AI and Machine Learning Will Reshape Jobs in the Next ...**
  - As we move toward 2035, these technologies will significantly alter employment structures, redefine skill demands, and give rise to a new generation of roles. The transformation won’t just be about automation; it will challenge conventional job categories, demand agile learning, and present opportunities for reinvention. This blog dissects how AI and ML will influence employment over the next decade spotlighting key sectors, workforce trends, and actionable strategies. [...] The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that computer and information research scientist positions, including AI specialists, will grow by 23% from 2022 to 2032, much faster than the average for all occupations.

# Industry-Specific Transformations

Different sectors will experience varying degrees and types of AI-driven transformation:

# Healthcare [...] The Brookings Institution predicts that by 2035, up to 30% of workers may operate under hybrid compensation models that include elements of both traditional employment and gig-economy-style payment structures.

# The Skills Revolution

Perhaps the most critical aspect of AI’s impact on jobs involves the dramatic shift in required skills. The OECD estimates that 50% of all employees will need significant reskilling by 2027 due to AI-driven changes.

# Declining Skills
- **How AI Is Transforming Deskless Jobs, Skills, and Career Paths**
  - As AI continues to reshape the workforce, its impact extends beyond job displacement or augmentation. For many deskless workers, the nature of their roles is evolving — from performing manual tasks to operating, monitoring, and collaborating with AI-driven tools. This shift is redefining job responsibilities, skill requirements, and career pathways across industries.

How AI Is Changing Deskless Jobs
-------------------------------- [...] While AI is creating new needs for deskless workers to reskill, it is also opening up new career paths for current employees in some industries, Le Clair said.

“In the security industry, for example, AI-driven monitoring and the management of drones can offer higher paying jobs for security personnel,” he said. “In janitorial work, the use of automation is making the job safer and cleaner in many respects.” [...] “Advancements in AI are transforming deskless job roles across industries by automating repetitive tasks and reshaping traditional workflows,” said Jamie Mackenzie, partner and HR and Talent Transformation Offering lead at IBM.
- **Skill shift: Automation and the future of the workforce - McKinsey**
  - To measure skill shifts from automation and AI, we modeled skill shifts going forward to 2030âand found that they accelerated. While the demand for technological skills has been growing since 2002, it will gather pace in the 2016 to 2030 period. The increase in the need for social and emotional skills will similarly accelerate. By contrast, the need for both basic cognitive skills and physical and manual skills will decline (Exhibit 1). [...] ![Automation and artificial intelligence will accelerate the shift in skills that the workforce needs.](/~/media/mckinsey/industries/public%20and%20social%20sector/our%20insights/skill%20shift%20automation%20and%20the%20future%20of%20the%20workforce/svgz-futureworkforce-ex1-v2.svgz?cq=50&cpy=Center) [...] Financial services have been at the forefront of digital adoption, and the banking and insurance sector is likely to see significantly shifting demand for skills through 2030. The financial-services sector contains a range of potential uses for AI, especially in forecasting risk and personalizing the marketing of products to customers. The number of workers such as tellers, accountants, and brokerage clerks will decline as automation is adopted. The need for a workforce that uses only basic

### 3. What ethical frameworks are needed to ensure fairness in AI-driven hiring and job displacement?
- **Ethical AI in Recruitment: Ensuring Fairness and Transparency**
  - Moreover, ethical decision-making frameworks need to be established within organizations. These frameworks should encompass the principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability. They can guide the responsible use of AI and provide a basis for resolving ethical dilemmas that might arise during the recruitment process. [...] Fairness is a fundamental aspect of ethical AI in recruitment, aimed at eliminating bias and ensuring equal opportunities for all candidates. To achieve fairness, several key considerations must be addressed in the implementation of [AI-driven recruitment processes](https://hirebee.ai/blog/recruitment-metrics-and-analytics/ai-powered-reporting-and-analytics-empowering-data-driven-hr-decision-making/). [...] Firstly, fairness and [unbiased data](https://hirebee.ai/blog/recruitment-metrics-and-analytics/how-to-leverage-ats-data-for-data-driven-hiring/) form the foundation of ethical AI. To achieve this, organizations must ensure that the data used for training AI models is diverse, representative, and free from any historical biases. Additionally, they need to address inherent biases that may exist in the data to prevent perpetuating unfair practices.
- **The Ethical Implications of AI and Job Displacement - Sogeti Labs**
  - THE ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS OF AI AND JOB DISPLACEMENT The displacement of jobs by AI raises several ethical concerns that extend beyond the immediate impact on employment. Corporate Accountability: Companies that deploy AI technologies have an ethical responsibility to consider the broader impact of job displacement. Retraining and Education: Displaced workers often lack access to the training and education necessary to transition to new jobs in the AI-driven economy. Addressing the ethical implications of AI-induced job displacement requires a multi-faceted approach that involves governments, businesses, educational institutions, and society. The ethical implications of AI and job displacement are complex and multifaceted. Ultimately, addressing the ethical implications of AI and job displacement requires a collaborative effort involving policymakers, businesses, labor unions, and civil society.
- **Balancing Ethics and Efficiency in AI-Driven Recruitment**
  - Alignment with Social Values. Ethical considerations also ensure that AI-driven hiring practices align with broader societal values and legal frameworks.

### 4. How will AI impact income inequality and the distribution of economic benefits in the workforce?
- **Analyzing wealth distribution effects of artificial intelligence**
  - These conflicting perspectives and findings highlight the complexities and unresolved debates within current research. Some studies present AI as a catalyst for economic growth and higher capital share, while others emphasize the risks of increased income inequality and reduced labor share. The divergent findings suggest that the impact of AI on capital share and income distribution is multifaceted and context-dependent, requiring a nuanced approach to policy and further empirical research to [...] Secondly, the study does not consider the potential for AI to cause unemployment. Increased automation could lead to job losses, significantly affecting income inequality. By focusing solely on the productivity effects of AI, the model may underestimate its broader economic consequences. Future research should integrate unemployment mechanisms to provide a more holistic analysis of AI's impact on wealth inequality. [...] \[[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844025003238#bib8)\]point out that the rapid development and integration of AI technologies into production processes have disproportionately affected routine and manual labor, exacerbating income inequality and unemployment among low-skilled workers.
- **[PDF] The economic impact of AI on employment and income disparities**
  - of decoupling, it is essential to understand how increasingly-capable AI systems might contribute to increasing polarization in the U.S. job market. 3. How AI stands to exacerbate polarization and income inequality Without intervention, AI will exacerbate a problem that has plagued the United States workforce for decades: wage increases will go to the highest earners, and the lowest earners will have modest to no growth in their incomes. There is no reason to believe things will happen any [...] skills. In the absence of these qualifications the worker can spiral downwards towards destitution. In lower income and education levels, the change in worker position to a lateral equivalent may not be possible. Few marketable skills and greater supply of low skill labor can increase the probability that the next job will also be low skill, lower pay, and with few, if any, benefits. AI can alleviate or exacerbate income inequalities. Evidence thus far about the impact of labor saving AI is
- **AI's impact on income inequality in the US - Brookings Institution**
  - The first mechanism through which AI could increase inequality is by giving a stronger productivity boost to already highly-paid knowledge workers, while leaving many lower-skilled workers in in-person service and manual labor jobs behind. In a recently published study that I worked on with my co-authors Tyna Eloundou, Daniel Rock, and Pamela Mishkin, we found evidence to suggest that higher-income workers are in fact more likely to experience productivity boosts from AI. As the technology matures, the relatively larger productivity gains we’re currently observing for lower-skilled workers in occupations exposed to AI would, in this scenario, end up transitioning into greater risk of job displacement for those same workers.

An Appendix is provided to summarize key job displacement and creation data, as well as the skills required for the future workforce. [...] While AI will phase out some jobs, it will also be a powerful job creation engine – spawning new roles, industries, and opportunities. History shows that technological revolutions (from steam engines to the internet) ultimately create more jobs than they destroy, though often in different areas. Likewise, the AI revolution will generate entirely new categories of work and boost demand in certain fields. Here, we identify the new jobs and industries expected to grow through 2030, including [...] *   Job Losses vs. Job Gains: The World Economic Forum forecasts that by 2030, 92 million jobs will be displaced by AI/automation globally, while 170 million new jobs will be created – a net gain of +78 million jobs ([Future of Jobs Report 2025: The jobs of the future – and the skills you need to get them | World Economic
